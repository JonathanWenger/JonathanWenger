## Welcome!

**JonathanWenger/JonathanWenger** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

I am a graduate student in computer science at the [University of TÃ¼bingen](https://uni-tuebingen.de/en/) and the [MPI for Intelligent Systems](https://www.is.mpg.de/en).

I am interested in the connections between **numerical analysis** ðŸ“Ÿ ðŸ“ˆ and **probabilistic machine learning** ðŸ’»ðŸ§ .

My research focuses on [**probabilistic numerics**](http://probabilistic-numerics.org/) which aims to quantify uncertainty induced by finite computation or stochastic input by interpreting numerical methods as inference problems.
