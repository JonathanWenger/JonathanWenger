## Welcome!
<!--
**JonathanWenger/JonathanWenger** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

I am a postdoc in statistics at [Columbia University's Zuckerman Institute](https://zuckermaninstitute.columbia.edu/) and I am interested in the connections between **numerical analysis** 💻 and **probabilistic machine learning** 🧠. 

My research focuses on [**probabilistic numerics**](http://probabilistic-numerics.org/) which aims to quantify uncertainty induced by finite computation or stochastic input by interpreting numerical methods as probabilistic inference.
